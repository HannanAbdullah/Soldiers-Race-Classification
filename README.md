# Soldiers-Race-Classification

<p>The 2012 US Army Anthropometric Survey (ANSUR II) was executed by the Natick Soldier Research, Development and Engineering Center (NSRDEC) from October 2010 to April 2012 and is comprised of personnel representing the total US Army force to include the US Army Active Duty, Reserves, and National Guard. In addition to the anthropometric and demographic data described below, the ANSUR II database also consists of 3D whole body, foot, and head scans of Soldier participants. These 3D data are not publicly available out of respect for the privacy of ANSUR II participants. The data from this survey are used for a wide range of equipment design, sizing, and tariffing applications within the military and has many potential commercial, industrial, and academic applications.</p>

<p>The ANSUR II working databases contain 93 anthropometric measurements which were directly measured, and 15 demographic/administrative variables explained below. The ANSUR II Male working database contains a total sample of 4,082 subjects. The ANSUR II Female working database contains a total sample of 1,986 subjects.</p>

<p>In this project, I implemented ***Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, XGBoost, Random Forest*** algorithms. Also, I evaluated the success of the models with appropriate performance metrics. At the end, I choosed the most successful model and tried to enhance the scores with ***SMOTE*** make it ready to deploy. Furthermore, I used ***SHAP*** to explain how the best model I choosed works.</p>
